Question 3
Please describe briefly what you plan to do in 1-3 paragraphs.
After team discussion, we decided to do the game Tetris (tile-matching puzzle game). Instead of doing it in 
traditional way, we want to make the game harder by changing the color of tiles into transparent.
In other words, when people play the game, they know what the next tile is coming (we will have a ¡°tile shape 
coming¡± notification). But when the tile is dropping down, people cannot see it because it is transparent. 
People have to remember what the shape is and decide where to put it. When the tile touches the ground, it will 
appear original color and shape. People can plan their playing strategy accordingly, and they need to memorize 
every step that they did. As playing levels go up, the tile dropping speed will go faster as well.
 
 
 
 
Question 4
Describe briefly what you foresee may be the risks in your proposed project and how your team may address them. 
For example, what would happen if the only team member qualified to implement certain functionality became ill 
or a software package you wish to use did not work as expected?
For doing this game, we need to learn a lot information about UI display, movement control and programming 
libraries and third party tools like SDL. We also need to worry about how the game should be design. We have 
confidence we can do it well.
From brainstorming, we came up 17 project ideas. If the Tetris idea cannot work, we are probably going to do 
some other fun games.
 
-CatFish: a cute cat is fishing fishes
-Coffee Cup: pour coffee into a cup within certain range only and cannot overflow the cup.
