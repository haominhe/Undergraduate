def transcribe(S):
    '''(string) -> string

    This fuction has one parameter, a string S, which will have DNA nucleotides
    (capital letter As, C, Gs, and Ts). There may be other characters, too, though
    they will be ignored by your transcribe function -- these might be spaces or
    other characters that are not really DNA nucleotides.
    Then, transcribe should return as output the messenger RNA that would be produced
    from that string S. The correct output simply uses replacement:
    'A's in the input become 'U's in the output.
    'C's in the input become 'G's in the output.
    'G's in the input become 'C's in the output.
    'T's in the input become 'A's in the output.
    Any other input characters should not appear in the output.
